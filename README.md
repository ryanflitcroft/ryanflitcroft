**Hi! I'm Ryan, and I like writing code üòÅüíª** 

I'm a software developer, based in Portland, Oregon.

Experienced contributor to full-stack software applications in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, & SQL.

I like writing code that is creative, organized, and accessible.

I like to spend my free time taking photos on film, riding bikes or roller skating, and going out for coffee and brunch. 

Feel free to say hey.

Thanks for checking out my page!
