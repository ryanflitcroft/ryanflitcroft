# Hi there

I'm Ryan, and I'm located in Portland, Oregon.

I'm a freelance photographer, currently studying to be a full-stack JavaScript developer.

I will be graduating from Alchemy Code Lab in June, 2022.

Hoping to join your team as a creative, curious, observant, and meticulous junior developer some time around then!

Thanks for checking out my work!!
