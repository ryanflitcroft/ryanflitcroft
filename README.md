Hi there! I'm Ryan ðŸ‘‹

I'm located in Portland, Oregon. 

I'm currently studying to become a full-stack software developer.

I will be graduating from Alchemy Code Lab in June 2022.

Hoping to join your team as a creative, curious, and meticulous JS developer some time around then!

Thanks for checking out my profile!
